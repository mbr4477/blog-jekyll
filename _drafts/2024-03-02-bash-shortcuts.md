title: "Using the Command Line: Shortcuts"

Last week I found myself deep in the command line, mashing the tab and arrow keys every few seconds
to jump between and re-run commands.
Thinking about how much I relied on a few key shortcuts
reminded me of how painful learning to use the terminal can be
without them.
Having to retype a 60-character string of command arguments
or slowly pound out a lengthy input file path 
is enough to frustrate the most seasoned software engineer.
Thank goodness for autocomplete and command histories.

It's absurd to think how many times a day my finger darts to the up arrow key
to bring back the previous command.
The up and down arrows let you "scroll" through your history
to quickly re-run past entries.
It doesn't take long for my right hand to memorize the up-arrow-then-enter-key
to scroll back and run the last command.

Equally as valuable is using tab to autocomplete commands or file paths.
If you type the first few letters and hit tab,
the shell will autocomplete if there is an unambiguous answer.
If multiple options could complete the line,
most will print out a list of possible completions.
Type a few more letters of the one you want,
hit tab again,
and the watch the rest suddenly appear.


Paragraphs:
1. Bash/terminals has shortcuts that can make you lightning fast at the command line
2. Tab to autocomplete. Double tab to see a list of options
3. Arrow keys up/down to scroll through command history
4. Building the muscle memory to tab/arrow keys pays off
