Here are a few lightning round thoughts after four years in a Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D. program at the University of Kentucky.

**My experience was draining at times but not all-consuming.**

I've heard of truly terrible PhD student experiences with overbearing advisors who provide little to no direction and expect students to work at all hours. This was not my experience. The takeaway here is that picking your PhD advisor is critical. Look for someone with an agreeable personality and similar work philosophy rather than jumping at the first opportunity. However, I realize that not everyone has this luxury, especially international students who may not be able to meet with an advisor before joining a lab.

**Publishing research is about "playing the game."**

While quality research will usually get published, lots of low-quality research makes it through peer review process. These papers know what reviewers look for&mdash;keywords, nice graphs and figures, higher performance numbers, etc.&mdash;and lean on incremental work without producing truly novel ideas. While I would never recommend settling for poor quality research just because you can, if you typically have very high standards for your work, the takeaway here is that every paper doesn't have to be groundbreaking stuff that goes in *Nature*.

**Grad students are unique&mdash;and not usually in a good way.**

Grad students get the short end of the stick in nearly every situation. You're a student but expected to keep working during spring break, winter break, etc. You're an employee but only get a small stipend and minimal benefits (no paid time off, student-level health insurance, etc.). You're contracted and paid for 20 hours of assistantship work per week but often need to and are expected to work a full 40 hours.

**The opportunity cost can be high.**

If a PhD takes you five years during which you could've earned \$80,000 in industry, you likely will miss out on \$250,000 of wages. That's a lot of money, and depending on your field, a PhD probably won't dramatically improve your earning potential. If I had pondered that much before starting my PhD, I'm not sure I would've done it. It's unfortunate that the contributions of PhD students are so undervalued compared to the value the same people with the same skills can offer to industry.

Broadly speaking, the explanation for lower salaries is that most research isn't commerically viable 
and thus requires public funding.
While professors are paid somewhat more, students are just students and paid less since they can't contribute like a faculty member.

I disagree with this logic.

First, while basic research relies on public funding, many engineering fields (should) deal with real problems.
File some patents, spin up a startup using lab research, and employ your grad students to funnel the revenue back to them.

Second, it's silly to say students are just students so they shouldn't expect to get paid more.
Industry companies expect that new hires will have to spend time learning before they can make big contributions,
but they don't dock *more than 50\% of the employee's market value* until this happens.

Third, even if they have to learn on the job, students do an enormous amount (all?) of the legwork to actually implement ideas
and write the papers that get published. This isn't to minimize the behind-the-scenes advising, administrative, and funding work
of the faculty member that is absolutely necessary, but faculty is crippled without graduate students. No work could be done.

The criticisms here aren't the fault of any specific faculty member. It's ingrained in the system. Honestly, advisors probably can't pay students more even if they wanted to. Such a high budget for students might seem like an irresponsible expense for a grant when other proposals could get away with paying students less. *C'est la vie.*

**A PhD doesn't "teach" you how to learn. It forces you to figure it out.**

While it might be true that PhD graduates know how to learn and innovate (in a very specific field),
I would say this is more out of necessity than any formal instruction.
You don't know how to implement your research, so you figure it out by trial and error using
